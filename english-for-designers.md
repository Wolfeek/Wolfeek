## About

# Martina Volfová

I love to use colors and litle more spase between objects (in graphic design). It can be maybe due to my dyslexia, ADHD etc.

I love coloring contrast in my graphic workI often take to Twitter to ask for help when I get stuck on a task or am looking for recommendations for tools/resources/strategies/solutions. Seconds after posting my quandary, my stream gets flooded with a host of advice, links, insights, and opinions. "Just" makes me feel like an idiot. This "crowd-sourcing my knowledgesphere" is a wonderful thing, but one word in all those proffered solutions tends to stick out in my mind like a jagged, rusty nail ready to figuratively jam itself into my eye socket. As in "Just update your ruby gems, generate a new SSH key, and run a git rebase..."

We approach problems equipped with our own set of experiences, perspective, and skills. It's extremely challenging to step outside of our own perspective when communicating with others, but it's increasingly essential to do so. Imagine yourself explaining a particular task to an earlier version of yourself. Provide context. The beauty of hypertext is that we're able to quickly add much-needed context helpful for n00bs but easy enough for those already in-the-know to scan over. The amount of available knowledge in our field (or any field really) is growing larger, more complex, and more segmented all the time.

Because of this, we have to be careful not to make too many assumptions in our documentation, blog posts, tutorials, wikis, and communications. "Just" presumes I come from a specific background, studied certain courses in university, am fluent in certain technologies, and have read all the right books, articles, and resources. In addition to learning the fundamentals, there's an expectation to be proficient in an increasingly exhausting laundry list of buzzwords and technologies. I'm seven years into my career and still feel like I'm still on Chapter 1 of the Big Book of Web Design. So think twice before suggesting someone "just" [insert any task here]. You just might make them feel like an idiot.
